# README file for risk game simulation
This repo simulates battles in the board game Risk between armies of equal size in order to determine how often the attacking or defending side wins based on the starting army size. There are two simulations in the repo, an object oriented set of modules and a functional module, both of which attempt to simulate the above conditions. 

usage: run pete's main.py

## Files Stephen (Functional)
1. risk_game_simulation.py
    * main file for stephen's version of the risk simulator
